Based on the Lagrange multiplier method (LMM), we propose a novel event-based weight binarization (eWB) algorithm for spiking neural networks (SNNs) with binary synaptic weights (-1, 1). The algorithm features (i) event-based asymptotic weight binarization using local data only, (ii) full compatibility with event-based learning algorithms (e.g., spike timing-dependent plasticity and event-driven random backpropagation (eRBP) algorithm), and (iii) the capability to address various constraints (including the binary weight constraint). As a proof of concept, we combine eWB with eRBP (eWB-eRBP) to obtain a single algorithm for learning binary weights to generate correct classifications.
